<p><b style="color:purple;">You know what they say from the light of the stars
until it reaches the earth for a year...</b></p>
<p style=" color:purple; ">So the sky  that I see tonight the evening
When I was young he had formed And tonight with three friends I long for the old ones
and when I break it I will go to the old neighborhood
To stand alone in my licensed playground
My Saturday teenage my most beautiful evening
Let me remember and write about  that time
A melody I whistle by walking push me
Let's go around here a little bit
And before I figure it out in my old house I've found myself
And I see lights
I see a world having a celebration
Have changed in the lounge decoration
And where he had been warm
Now there are many people
A decline is celebrated as vampires until the morning
And they make a noise
So much noise
This part was familiar
I was a child small and immature
I hear the sound from a distance now
I was playing ball here
Some are celebrating where I am
I spent my adolescence
And everything has changed
In my home the parent
Who are these?
Where are my posters?
Where are my remorse?
And my memories
Where is my garden?
My flowers
Where are my notebooks and songs?
Where are the children from the neighborhood?
Everyone was lost
Everybody changed faces
They all wore masks
The lights in their homes are closed
The trees in the neighborhood
They have lost their sheets
They have lost their friends
The children
Balla does not play anymore
And I look like shades
I turn around in the haze
I'm looking for a corner home to turn
to calm down but I do not see any
Where are the dreams for today?
I can only see clouds through clouds
Only autumn and Sundays
Roughly shaky and evasive
And all our parks became forests
And our squares dumps
And if tonight I'm not okay
It is because this was my home yesterday
And I'm on the stairs
And the frozen air touches my eyes
All these were in the rooms I spent the most difficult of my nights
They party and celebrate the decadence
And my voice does not sound that way
Why all of them together
They make noise
So much noise
This part was familiar
I was a child small and immature
Now I hear the sound from a distance
I was playing ball here
Some celebrate where I am
I passed my teenage years
And everything has changed in my father's home
And they make a noise
So much noise
This place was familiar
I was a kid small and immature
Now I hear the sound from a distance
I was playing ball here
Some celebrate where I am
I spent my teenage years
And everything has changed in my home the parent
And they make noise
So much noise
This place was familiar
I was a kid small and immature
Now I hear the sound from a distance
I was playing ball here
Some celebrate where I am
I spent my teenage years
And everything has changed in my home the parent
They make noise
