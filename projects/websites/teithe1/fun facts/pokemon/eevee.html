        <p> Eevee (イーブイ) is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, it first appeared in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue. It has later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles, and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. It would become the game mascot and starter Pokémon for Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!.

Known as the Evolution Pokémon in the games and the anime,Eevee is a rabbit-eared feline-like Pokémon with an unstable genetic code, which allows it to evolve into one of eight different Pokémon, informally known as "Eeveelutions", depending on the situation. The first three of these evolutions, Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon, were introduced alongside Eevee in Pokémon Red and Blue. Five more evolutions have since been introduced in Pokémon games: Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon. 

Known as the Balloon Pokémon, Jigglypuff evolves from Igglybuff when it reaches a certain point of happiness, and evolves into Wigglytuff when exposed to a Moon Stone. Its name is a combination of the words "jiggly" and "puff", intended to relate to its jelly-like appearance. The character has been featured in a recurring role in the anime series and served as the focus for several printed adaptions of the franchise. Since it appeared in the Pokémon series, Jigglypuff has received generally positive reception. It has been featured in several forms of merchandise, including figurines, plush toys, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game.   </p>

         <p>The design and art for Eevee and its evolutions were provided by Japanese video game designer and illustrator Ken Sugimori,a friend of the Pokémon franchises' creator, Satoshi Tajiri. In the original Japanese games, the Pokémon was known by its name Eievui, a name which has similar prefixes to its current English name. However, before the English versions of the games were released, Eevee was originally going to be named Eon rather than Eevee. It was renamed to "Eevee" shortly before the English releases of Pokémon Red and Blue.[citation needed]
